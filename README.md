# Basketball-Data-Visualization
A repo that showcases a project I worked on regarding creating data visualizations for the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University Men's basketball team.

## Goal:
This project was focused on creating visuals to showcase how different metrics affected the wins and losses for the 2019-2020 NCAT Men's basketball team.

The process began with collecting and cleaning the raw dataset (will be added), ensuring that missing values were addressed and that key variables such as points, rebounds, assists, and shooting efficiency were properly formatted. Once the dataset was prepared, I used R/ visualization libraries to generate a variety of plots — including scatter plots, bar charts, and interactive dashboards — each designed to reveal specific insights about team statistics/metrics and how they affected wins and losses. Throughout the process, emphasis was placed on clarity and interpretability so that both technical and non-technical audiences could easily understand the story told by the data.

The final results provided several actionable insights. For example, the visualizations highlighted trends in turnover-to-assist ratios and illustrated how our overall effective field goal percentage seems to contribute to more wins when higher. The efg% metric was not initally included in the dataset I recieved but I added it to the data that was already provided. By combining static charts with interactive features, the project allowed users to dive deeper into specific teams of interest. Ultimately, this visualization project demonstrated the power of data storytelling in sports analytics — turning raw numbers into meaningful narratives that can inform coaching decisions, fan engagement, and future research.
